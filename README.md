# Steven: view, calculate, and delete expenses 
# Kai: Def main, added the options of all the functions
#yifan: add expense

#We forgot how to add collaborators so we spent a little bit of time trying to figure out how to commit changes. 
#figuring out the add expense function was also challenging, so we searched it online and figured it out.
#We do not enjoy collaborative coding as it is challenging to combine code that different people have made.
